## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Payment Service
```python
class PaymentService:
    async def create_payment(order, payment_method, metadata)
    async def get_payment_by_id(payment_id)
    async def get_payment_by_order_id(order_id)
    async def update_payment_status(payment, status, ...)
    async def process_successful_payment(order_id, payment_id, ...)
    async def process_failed_payment(payment_id, error_message)
```

### Telegram Payments Service
```python
class TelegramPaymentsService:
    async def create_invoice(chat_id, order, payment)
    async def answer_pre_checkout_query(query_id, ok, error_message)
    async def refund_payment(charge_id, amount)
    @staticmethod def extract_payment_data_from_payload(payload)
    @staticmethod def format_payment_success_message(order, payment)
    @staticmethod def format_payment_failed_message(order, error)
```

### Payment Utilities
```python
class PaymentUtils:
    @staticmethod def verify_webhook_signature(payload, signature, secret)
    @staticmethod def validate_payment_amount(amount, min_amount, max_amount)
    @staticmethod def normalize_amount(amount)
    @staticmethod def kopecks_to_rubles(kopecks)
    @staticmethod def rubles_to_kopecks(rubles)
    @staticmethod def format_amount(amount, currency)
    @staticmethod def generate_payment_description(order_id, items_count, customer_name)
```

## 🔒 Security Features

### Webhook Security
- **Signature Verification**: HMAC-SHA256 signature validation
- **Payload Validation**: Complete request validation
- **Error Handling**: Secure error responses without data leakage

### Data Protection
- **Metadata Sanitization**: Automatic removal of sensitive data
- **Test Mode Detection**: Identification of test vs production payments
- **Amount Validation**: Comprehensive amount validation and normalization

## 📊 Business Logic

### Payment Workflow
1. **Order Creation** → Automatic payment creation for non-cash orders
2. **Invoice Generation** → Telegram invoice sent to user
3. **Pre-checkout Validation** → Order and payment verification
4. **Payment Processing** → Success/failure handling
5. **Status Updates** → Order status synchronized with payment
6. **Notifications** → Real-time updates to user and admin

### Order Status Integration
- `pending` → `confirmed` (on successful payment)
- `pending` → `cancelled` (on failed payment)
- Automatic status transitions based on payment events

### Minimum Order Amount
- Configurable minimum order amount (default: 1500₽)
- Validation at both order creation and payment processing
- Business rule enforcement across all payment methods

## 🔔 Notification System

### User Notifications
- **Payment Success**: Detailed success message with transaction ID
- **Payment Failure**: Error message with retry instructions
- **Payment Status**: Command to check payment status

### Admin Notifications
- **New Paid Order**: Immediate notification of successful payments
- **Payment Failures**: Alert for failed payment attempts
- **Status Changes**: Real-time order status updates

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Payment utilities and validation functions
- **Integration Tests**: Database operations and service methods
- **Workflow Tests**: Complete payment flow simulation
- **API Tests**: Endpoint validation and error handling

### Test Script
- `test_payments.py` - Comprehensive test suite
- Tests all major components and workflows
- Validates security and business logic
- Simulates complete payment scenarios

## 🚀 Deployment Configuration

```

### Database Migration
```bash
# Run payment table migration
alembic upgrade head
```

### Production Setup
1. **Update provider token** to production token
2. **Configure webhook URL** to your domain
3. **Set up SSL certificate** for webhook security
4. **Configure monitoring** for payment events
5. **Test with small amounts** before full deployment

## 📈 Performance Considerations
